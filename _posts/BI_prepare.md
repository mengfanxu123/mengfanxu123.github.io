### 销售预测


I was presented with a 9-step procedure to forecast unit sales based on the previous 12 weeks and the history over the past two years, and a general notion that it combines a static average, a linear trend, and a function modeling seasonality. I was given 25 mins to come up with explanations what each step did.

The first set of 15 or so IF statements removes (spurious) spikes in units sold. Using those, new averages for the most recent 8 weeks and weeks 5 - 12 are computed. Then, the ratios of actual units sold relative to their linear prediction for each week, drawing on the data one and two years ago, result in a seasonality weight. Finally, the size of an order is (estimated)估计, taking into account the maximum lead time needed, as well as unfilled orders from the backlog and previously placed orders that haven't arrived yet.


Tell me about Yourself followed by couple of small questions like - If I want to increase revenue by selling bedroom items from catalogue which are sent to existing customers which existing customer will you target?

### five years


### If we used to promote our products by small catalogs and we want to change to larger ones, how can we decide our target consumers


### Given the former transaction rate, profit and cost, what will be the number of large catalogs if we want to create the same profit  



### question

1. Wayfair is going to send 2 different catalogs to their  customers. One of the catalogs costs 50 cents to make and is 50 pages long. The conversion rate for the catalog is 5% and each customer brings in 315 dollars. The second catalog costs 95 cents to make, is 100 pages long and each customer brings in 300 dollars from it. The profit margin is 30%. What should the conversion rate for the second catalog be to make at least the same amount of profit as the first one. After you find the conversion rate for the second one, there is a second part of the problem. Wayfair is planning to make a new catalog which is going to cost 10 cents more than the 100 page one. The more expensive catalog is going to be sent out to 20% of the customers while the remaining 80% are going to get the 100 page one. Assume the same 30% profit margin and 300 dollar profit from each customer. What should the conversion rate for the new catalog be in order to receive the same profit at the end?

2. 50,000 shoppers with a 0.5% conversion rate for a chair that costs $250. Wayfair makes a 27% profit. Next, 50,000 shoppers will get a 10% discount. What is the conversion rate they must achieve to achieve the same profits as before?
